                <p class="lead">I was born in Tucson, Arizona and was raised in Pheonix, Arizona for 14 years. I moved to Austin, Texas in the middle of highschool and graduated from Cedar Ridge Highschool. I've spent the last 6 years in and out of restaurants as a server, and the last 2 years I was bartending in The Domain. I've taken it upon myself that 
                    I am in great need of something I can build off of, and truely grow as an individual. Most of my life I've rebuilt engines and worked on tuned street cars from scratch. Recently, Ive been building gaming rigs and computers for myself, and all of my friends, and most of the furnature in my room is hand made by myself. I find a thrill when
                    it comes to anything I can build myself from the ground up. I've tried a few different degree plans at Austin Community College, and none of them have compared to just one week of University of Texas' Course. I've never felt more confident on what I want to do and accomplish prior to the course at UT.
